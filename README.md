## Project Description
My first compulsory had deliverance 2 weeks into the first semester. Here, I were to make a playable "tic-tac-toe"-game using button inputs.
<br>
<br>
As I had just start learning C++, I was intrigued of what could be done with minimal knowledge. So I wanted to see what I was possibly capable to do.
<br>
<br>

I made 2 game modes (PvP and PvC) where I made a simple AI controlling your opponent in the PvC-mode.
<br>
<br>
I also made it possible to change player names and icons displayed in-game, together with a scoreboard to keep track of the score.
<br>
<br>
The "Reset" made a clear save, if players where to swap.
