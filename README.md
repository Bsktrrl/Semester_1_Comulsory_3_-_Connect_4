## Project Description
This was my third compulsory in the "Programming I" course. Here, I were to make a playable "Connect 4"-game using button inputs with a more interractive menu.
<br>
<br>
Here I wanted to use everything I had learned through the last 2 months, making an AI able to play Computer vs. Computer.
I managed to make "animations", so it seemed that the computer was thinking on it next move by moving the dropPoint on top op the grid.
<br>
<br>
As with "tic-tac-toe" I wanted to make it possible for the players to personalize themself by adding change of name, icon and color. This time I had also learned saving to file, so I added this function as well, for future play, with a possibility of resetting the save data.
